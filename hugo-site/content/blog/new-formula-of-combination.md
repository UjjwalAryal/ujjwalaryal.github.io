Combination is a selection of items from a collection, such that (unlike permutations) the order of selection does not matter. More formally, a k-combination of a set S is a subset of k distinct elements of S. If the set has n elements, the number of k-combinations is equal to the binomial coefficient.

which can be written using factorials as  whenever k\leq n, and which is zero when k>n. The set of all k-combinations of a set S is often denoted by {\displaystyle \textstyle {\binom {S}{k}}}.
