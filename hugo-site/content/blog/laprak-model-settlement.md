### Introduction

When you reach Laprak of Gorkha DIstrict, you will see a nicely built colony of 573 houses for earthquake-hit people. It seems like a colony inside Kathmandu Valley when you see it from another hill. Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) started the construction of the settlement in January, 2017 with a plan of completing by October 2018. But due to several delays and difficulties it was not completed within the estimated time. Currently it is almost in the last phase of completion.

The NRNA signed an agreement with the National Reconstruction Authority to build houses for the quake displaced families at Gupsipakha with manpower support from Nepal Army. The settlement site is about 30 minutesâ€™ walk from the old settlement of Laprak which was destroyed by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in April 2015. Gupsipakha was chosen for resettlement after geologists had declared the old settlement a high landslide risk zone. The NRNA also plans to build a school, a health post and a Gurung museum at the site that spans over 18 hectares of land.

Last December, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to visit Laprak. We met the temporary Army camp built at the site and had a discussion on various things about the settlement. Currently, the construction of toilets and water supply is remaining which is being done by the help of the Nepal Army. The authority has already allocated the house for particular families.

One of the sad things was not seeing people residing even in the fully completed house. People are still residing in their partially demolished house. Is Laprak Model Settlement a successful or an unsuccessful project? Even after its completion, people didn't relocate to the new settlement.

### Role of ownership and local participation for a project to be successful

Discussing with the locals and Army head of the camp, we got to collect various reasons behind the people not relocating to the new settlement. I analysed personally also various reasons behind it.

In villages, people want open space for their cattles, storing woods for winter, kitchen gardening and so on. Since the new settlement is arranged in the grids and is meant for housing purpose only, it has relatively lesser space. So people find it difficult for their day to day activities in a congested place. 

Another reason behind it might be the lack of ownership and local participation of the public in the project. The authority assigned the house to the public after the partial completion of the houses. If they had allocated the houses before the project started and involved the people during construction, it might have added an emotional ownership of public towards the project. Involving the local people would have reduced the manpower cost also and they could have utilised various usable materials like wood from their old houses.


### A successful welfare project or death of diversity ?

I will analyse Laprak Model Settlement from another point of view also. Is it the death of diversity ?

Nepal has been a country of diversities, whether it be cultural, lingual and so on. Nepali villages are diverse in terms of ethnicity, festivals, rituals, culture, building houses, temples and so on. People design their own house and it maintains the cultural diversity of society. Making exactly the same design house in a village ends diversity. Better than building the same house the designs might have been decided by the owner.

So, a big question to every one of us. * Is Laprak Model Settlement a successful or an unsuccessful project? *
